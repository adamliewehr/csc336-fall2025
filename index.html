<h2 style="background-color: lightblue;">About</h2>

<p>I am a dedicated student and coach, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a minor in Education, as well as a Master of Science in Applied Computer Science, from American University. I have a passion for teaching and helping others grow, with experience as a Computer Science Teaching Assistant at American University and as a Long-Term Substitute Teacher at Westland Middle School. My coaching experience includes being a Swim Coach for Ashton Swim Club, where I worked with swimmers ages 5-18 to foster confidence and teamwork.</p>
