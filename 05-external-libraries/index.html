    <p>About: Welcome to π's Pizza! <b>Square pizzas are not welcome here.</b> </p>

        attention to detail, from the perfectly rounded crust to the mathematically balanced distribution of toppings.
        We invite you to experience a pizza that isn't just a meal—it's a tribute to the artistry and infinite
        possibilities of true circularity. Every bite is designed to be an experience that's both delicious and
        geometrically sound.</p>
